# Taxi Trips Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing and visualizing taxi trip data using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and numpy. The dataset was cleaned, transformed, and explored to extract meaningful insights related to trip duration, fare, payment types, and company distribution.

## Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw trip data.
- Handle missing values and duplicates.
- Perform exploratory data analysis to identify trends and patterns.
- Visualize insights related to payment types, companies, and trip characteristics.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Key Tasks Performed

- Removed unnecessary and null-heavy columns.
- Handled missing values using mean imputation and categorical replacement.
- Converted timestamp fields to datetime format.
- Standardized column names and rounded numerical values.
- Performed group-by operations for insights like average fare per payment type.
- Created visualizations for:
  - Payment type distribution (bar chart)
  - Company distribution (pie chart)

## Key Insights

- Identified average trip durations and fares by payment method.
- Determined the distribution of payment types and company usage.
- Highlighted top pickup areas and most common payment methods.
- Explored tipping behavior across payment types.

## Output

Visual insights were produced through bar plots, pie charts, and summary statistics. Data was optionally saved to a cleaned CSV file for further analysis or reporting.
